Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event 
simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from 
a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. 
For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
If you would like to look at the JSON data within log_data files, you will need to create a pandas dataframe to read the data. Remember to first import JSON and pandas libraries.

df = pd.read_json(filepath, lines=True)

For example, df = pd.read_json('data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-01-events.json', lines=True) would read the data file 2018-11-01-events.json.
